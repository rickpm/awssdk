# CloudWatch code examples for the SDK for Ruby

## Overview

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for Ruby to work with Amazon CloudWatch.

*CloudWatch provides a reliable, scalable, and flexible monitoring solution that you can start using within minutes.*

## âš  Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

### Single actions
Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

* [Create an alarm](./cw-ruby-example-create-alarm.rb) (`CreateAlarm`)

* [Show alarms](./cw-ruby-example-show-alarms.rb) (`DescribeAlarms`)

* [Disable alarm actions](./cw-ruby-example-alarm-actions.rb) (`DisableAlarmActions`)



### Scenarios
Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.

* [Manage alarms](./cw-ruby-example-alarm-basics.rb)

* [Disable alarm actions](./cw-ruby-example-alarm-actions.rb)

* [Add metrics](./cw-ruby-example-metrics-basics.rb)
