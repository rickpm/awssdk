# ElasticBeanstalk code examples for the SDK for Ruby
## Overview
These examples show how to create and manage AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments using the SDK for Ruby.

ElasticBeanstalk allows you to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
